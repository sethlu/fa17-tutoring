{.#} Asymptotic Analysis & Amortization
{.#++}

What is asymptotic analysis? We frequently use *Θ(·)*, *O(·)* and *Ω(·)*, but what are the differences between them? Trivially, the tilde notation strictly defines something similar to the big-theta.

How is amortization related to asymptotic analysis? Think about `ArrayList` as an example with an amortized runtime. Will inserting a single item into an `ArrayList` have a worst runtime of *Θ(N<sup>2</sup>)* and a best runtime
