{.#} Order of Growth
{.#++}

What's the big-theta notation?

What are some things that may or may not affect the orders of growth? Consider constant terms, logarithms, nesting, lower-order terms.

On the spectrum of orders of growth, what's considered the "worst," as in runtime?

Try to come up with an example for each of the big-theta notations introduced in the course.
