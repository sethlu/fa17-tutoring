{.#} Extra Notes on `__repr__()`

Several scenarios while you are interacting with the Python interpreter.

```py
'abc' # 'abc' - There are quotation marks around it
1 # 1 - There's no quotation mark around it
```

However, things can become interesting working with custom objects in terms of `__repr__()`!

```py
class Foo:

  def __repr__(self):
    return 'abc'

f = Foo()
f # abc - There's no quotation mark around it
```

Compared to the following:

```py
class Bar:

  def __repr__(self):
    return "'abc'"

b = Bar()
b # 'abc' - There are quotation marks around it
```

{.#+} Take-Aways

However, when you are simply printing something out with `print()`, Python will display the `__str__()` of the object you passed to it.

When you are querying an statement/expression in REPL, Python will display the `__repr__()` of the object (if not `None`). You can think the following...

```py
'howdy' # 'howdy'
```

As `print(repr('howdy'))`, meaning you are printing out the *repr* for the string `'howdy'`.

*NB: Both `__repr__()` and `__str__()` needs to return strings.*
