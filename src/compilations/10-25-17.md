{.#} Tree Stuff

Consider the following implementation:

```py
def tree(label, branches=[]):
  return [label] + branches

def label(tree):
  return tree[0]

def branches(tree):
  return tree[1:]
```

There are multiple ways to get started on playing with such tree structure! As a few examples:

- Track 1
  1. Given a tree, how can we find a largest/smallest label in the leaves?
  1. Given a tree, how can we find a largest/smallest label in the tree?
  1. Given a tree, how can we find the sum of all labels (assuming all labels are numbers)?
- Track 2
  1. Given a tree, how can we clone it?
  1. Given a tree, how can we make a copy of it with all the leaves pruned?
- Track 3
  1. Given a tree and a label, how can we check if the label we want is in the tree?
  1. Given a tree, how can we check if there aren't any descendent nodes of a same label for any node in the tree?

{.#} Exceptions in Python

```py
try:
  pass # Some bunch of stuff
except Exception as e:
  pass # Do something regarding the exception
```

{.#} Scheme Syntax
{.#++}

{.#} Building Block

```scheme
1 ; 1

True ; True
```

{.#} Define Variables

```scheme
(define a 1) ; a

a ; 1

(define (foo x)
  (+ x 2)
) ; foo
; Is equivalent to the following
(define foo
  (lambda (x)
    (+ x 2)
  )
) ; foo

(foo 2) ; 4
```

{.#} Primitive Expressions

```scheme
(+ 1 2)

(display 2)
(print 1)

(cons 1 2)
(list 1 2)
```

Use the `=` predicate when you wish to test whether two numbers are equivalent.
Use the `eqv?` predicate when you wish to test whether two non-numeric values are equivalent.

{.#} Special Forms

```scheme
(if True 1 2) ; 1

(if True
  (/ 1 1)
  (/ 1 0)
) ; 1

(cond
  (False (/ 1 0))
  (True 1)
  (else 100)
) ; 1

(lambda (x)
  (/ 1 0)
) ; (lambda (x) (/ 1 0))

(and 0 False 1) ; False
(or 5 False (/ 1 0))
```

`(and ...)` returns the first false value, otherwise `True`.
`(or ...)` returns the first true value, otherwise `False`.

The boolean `False` is the only false value.

{.#} Quotes

```scheme
'a ; a
(quote a) ; a

'(1 2) ; (1 2)
(quote (1 2)) ; (1 2)

'(1 . 2) ; (1 . 2)
'(1 . ()) ; (1)
'(1 . (2 . (3))) ; (1 2 3)
```
