{.#} Stream

Introducing `cons-stream`, a special form that essentially delays the evaluation of the second half of the pair. You may want to consider using `cons-stream` instead of `cons` when constructing a infinitely long list--a stream.

Good practice: Code up functions for `map-stream`, `filter-stream` and `reduce-stream`.

{.#} SQL

{.#+} Syntax

Refer to [SQL As Understood By SQLite](https://sqlite.org/lang.html).

- **Create table** `create-table-stmt`

    <details><summary>Diagram</summary><img src="https://sqlite.org/images/syntax/create-table-stmt.gif"></details>

    Usage example:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE cities AS
      SELECT "Berkeley" as city, "California" as state UNION
      SELECT "San Francisco",    "California"          UNION
      SELECT "Houston",          "Texas";
    ```

- **Select** `select-stmt`

    <details><summary>Diagram</summary><img src="https://sqlite.org/images/syntax/select-stmt.gif"></details>

    Usage example:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM cities
      WHERE state="California"
      ORDER BY city ASC;
    ```

    A recursive *with-clause* will be introduced this Friday.
