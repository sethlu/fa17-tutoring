{.#} Iterables & Iterators

Iterables implement the `__iter__` method, and iterators (which are also iterables) additionally implement the `__next__` method. In an iterator, the iteration halts at `StopIterator` exception.

Generators produce iterators.

{.#} SQL

{.#+} Syntax

Refer to [SQL As Understood By SQLite](https://sqlite.org/lang.html).

- **Create table** `create-table-stmt`

    Usage example:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE cities AS
      SELECT "Berkeley" as city, "California" as state UNION
      SELECT "San Francisco",    "California"          UNION
      SELECT "Houston",          "Texas";
    ```

- **Select** `select-stmt`

    Usage example:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM cities
      WHERE state="California"
      ORDER BY city ASC;
    ```

    A recursive *with-clause* will be introduced this Friday.

{.#+} Demo for Recursive Selects

```sql
-- Family

create table family as
  select "Bob" as member, "Danny" as parent union
  select "Gaby", "Bob" union
  select "Lila", "Danny";

-- Discover all the ancestors for each of the family member

with ancestors(member, ancestor, distance) as (
  select member,        parent,             1                      from family union
  select family.member, ancestors.ancestor, ancestors.distance + 1 from family, ancestors
    where family.parent = ancestors.person
) select * from ancestors;

-- With a better formatting

with ancestors(member, ancestor, distance) as (
  select member,        parent,             1                      from family union
  select family.member, ancestors.ancestor, ancestors.distance + 1 from family, ancestors
    where family.parent = ancestors.person
) select person || " is of distance " || distance || " from " || ancestor from ancestors;
```

The basic algorithm for computing the content of the recursive table is as follows:

- Run the initial-select and add the results to a queue.
- While the queue is not empty:
    - Extract a single row from the queue.
    - Insert that single row into the recursive table
    - Pretend that the single row just extracted is the only row in the recursive table and run the recursive-select, adding all results to the queue.
