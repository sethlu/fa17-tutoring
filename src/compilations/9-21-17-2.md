{.#} Weekly Misc: Data Abstraction

One data abstraction introduced to the lecture so far: *Rational numbers*, represented by their numerators and denominators. Define *constructors* and *selectors* in very generalized terms.

Discuss the differences among Python `List` (& list comprehensions, unpacking), `String` (& some literals), `Dict`. Furthermore, their use cases and how they can be useful to abstract data (like how `List` can be used to represent a rational number behind an abstraction barrier).

Oh, and what's an *abstraction barrier* after all?

If with extra time, try to implement data abstraction with higher order functions *only*.
