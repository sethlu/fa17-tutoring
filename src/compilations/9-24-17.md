{.#} Access Control

Discuss `public`, `protected` and `private` members in a Java class. Which one has the highest order?

There's something called *package-private*, which goes side by side with Java packages (a little bit); where does it sit in the hierarchy of accessibilities? Though there's not an explicit *package-private* access modifier, the class members are default to have such accessibility.

What can be a good practical practice in coding? Leaving everything *package-private*? Making everything `private`?

Read more about [Controlling Access to Members of a Class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/accesscontrol.html) on the documentation for Java 8. (Btw, Java 9 is out!)

{.#} Type Casting

{.#+} Take-Aways

Upcasting should work without getting any compilation errors. Downcasting will get compilation error when without the parenthesis to force the type casting; however, forced type casting can potentially be open to runtime exceptions.

Figure out function call by the static type of the object, then call the function by the dynamic type.
