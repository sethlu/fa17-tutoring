{.#} Weekly Misc about Trees

They are naturally sustainable! Oh well, think about how <q>trees</q> are conceptually related to <q>pairs.</q> Define the terminologies around trees--tree, root, label, branch, leaf (the language we use may vary in different places).

Consider the following implementation:

```py
def tree(label, branches=[]):
  return [label] + branches
def label(tree):
  return tree[0]
def branches(tree):
  return tree[1:]
```

There are multiple ways to get started on playing with such tree structure! As a few examples:

1. Given a tree, how can we find a largest/smallest label in the leaves?
1. Given a tree, how can we find a largest/smallest label in the tree?
1. Given a tree, how can we find the sum of all labels (assuming all labels are numbers)?
1. Given a tree, how can we make a copy of it with all the leaves pruned? The function is non-destructive.
1. Given a tree and a label, how can we check if the label we want is in the tree?
1. Given a tree, how can we check if there aren't any descendent nodes of a same label for any node in the tree?
