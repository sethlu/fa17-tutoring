## Sampling

**Reducing a continuous-time signal to a discrete-time signal.** Think of it as recording sounds in a digital sound studio.

ü§î Some intuition: The continuous-time signal may be some sound picked up by the microphone, some image, some sine wave!?

üçø If time permits: Demo differently sampled audio tracks (in Adobe Audition)

### Nyquist theorem

**Nyquist frequency: Half the sampling frequency**
We get no aliasing from frequencies less than the Nyquist frequency.

As an example, for an image of stripes (black & white), if we're sampling at every `16px`, stripes at cycle every `32px` or more will result in no aliasing.

Also, if there are stripes that cycle at every `8px` (`4px` black, then `4px` white), we'd want to sample at every `4px` to avoid aliasing.

üëâ [Dorian's aliasing video reference](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xWQIFD03IYZvK3MhHIm8jKacLmzZNrun_IVqiMNdQdc/edit#slide=id.g4e32ab7712_0_86)

## Texture mapping

### Barycentric coordinates

{.raw}
\begin{align}
    (\alpha, \beta, \gamma), \alpha + \beta + \gamma = 1 \\
    P = \alpha A + \beta B + \gamma C \\
\end{align}
{./raw}

**We're only concering $R^2$ for this section**

{.link ../../demos/point-testing/index.md | Point in triangle test demo}

ü§î Do we really need to describe a point with all $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$? What if we drop $\alpha$?

{.raw}
\begin{align}
    P & = \alpha A + \beta B + \gamma C \\
    P & = (1 - \beta - \gamma) A + \beta B + \gamma C \\
    P & = A - \beta A - \gamma A + \beta B + \gamma C \\
    P - A & = \beta (B - A) + \gamma (C - A)
\end{align}
{./raw}

Now we can see it with $A$ as the origin, with $(B - A)$ and $(C - A)$ as two independent vectors.

This can lead us to another point-in-triangle test (that **doesn't worry about winding**). For any $P$, how can we tell its Barycentric coordinates? It's a change in frame of reference.

{.raw}
\begin{align}
    P - A & = \beta (B - A) + \gamma (C - A) \\
    \begin{bmatrix}B - A & C - A\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}\beta \\ \gamma\end{bmatrix} & = P - A \\
    \begin{bmatrix}\beta \\ \gamma\end{bmatrix} & = \begin{bmatrix}B - A & C - A\end{bmatrix}^{-1} (P - A)
\end{align}
{./raw}

This may look rather troublesome, but it lends to an approach for finding ray-triangle intersection in $R^3$ (more later).

üçø If time permits: Demo [Suzanne model](https://github.com/sethlu/renderbox/tree/85b8cd565f23d016106dd34921bda0e6bfee55dd/examples/objloader/src) (in Blender)

### Mipmaps

ü§î Why would you want mipmaps?
