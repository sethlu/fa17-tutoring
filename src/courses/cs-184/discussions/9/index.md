## Bullets

- Terminology
    - Focal length $f$
    - Field of view $fov$
    - Exposure
    - Shutter speed
    - Aperture $A$
    - F-stop $N = \frac{f}{A}$
    - Circle of confusion
    - Depth of field
- Field of view
    - Dolly zoom
    - Relate field of view to focal length $fov = 2 \arctan(\frac{h}{2f})$
- Exposure
    - Time * irradiance
    - F stop & shutter stop
- Thin lens approximation
    - Gaussian thin lens formula
        $\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{f_i}$
- Depth of field
    - Circle of confusion
- Light field
    - Digital refocusing
    - Resolution
        - Aperture plane resolution dependent on the number of pixels under each microlens
        - Microlens plane resolution dependent on the number of microlens
    - Sub-aperture image
        Represents an image taken with a pinhole camera at the location on the aperture plane
